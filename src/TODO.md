##DZ lib:
	- maxFiles issue: not taking into accoount previously uploaded files
	- correctly process situation when file is not accepted due to maxFiles, but if other file is removed, not accepted file can be uploaded.
		maybe add error reason field.
	- thumbnailing unrenderable files
	- strange thumbnail canvas behavior. seems it's shared between instances.


##DZ Field:
	- add editor |
	- Better handling of 'accepted' state. E.g. setting rejection reason | +
	- check maxc width for single col mode
